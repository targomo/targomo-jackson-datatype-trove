# targomo-jackson-datatype-trove
A module to serialize trove collection with the popular JSON libray

This is a forked project from https://bitbucket.org/marshallpierce/jackson-datatype-trove.
It has been slightly amended to work with our jackson version and we added a few serializers/deserializers. 
In the future we will potentially add more of them.
